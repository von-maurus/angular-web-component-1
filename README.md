# WebComponentDemo1

This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 16.0.0.

## Development server

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The application will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

## Code scaffolding

Run `ng generate component component-name` to generate a new component. You can also use `ng generate directive|pipe|service|class|guard|interface|enum|module`.

## Build

Run `ng build` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory.

## Running unit tests

Run `ng test` to execute the unit tests via [Karma](https://karma-runner.github.io).

## Running end-to-end tests

Run `ng e2e` to execute the end-to-end tests via a platform of your choice. To use this command, you need to first add a package that implements end-to-end testing capabilities.

# Summary
In short, we have:

- i) Added the Angular Elements library
- ii) Created an Angular component and converted it to a web component
- iii) Added bootstrapping and configured a separate build

In the example above, we use a simple Angular component to demonstrate the whole process of creating a web component.


## Investigations

- When building for production, use this command instead of the DEPRECATED one `ng build --configuration production`.
